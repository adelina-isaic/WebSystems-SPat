Many people having certain disabilities (visual, locomotory, etc.), medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or senior citizens often get lost in new cities or inside buildings. In order to help them, a smart (mobile) application is required, conforming to Web accessibility principles & guidelines. This Web application will be able to track the user movement – including by using sensors –, to register important health data (e.g., notifying the emergency medical services – if required – about the patient's condition, accidents, or panic/heart attacks), and to assist the person find the way out/in of a building/get back to her/his home. Various solutions concerning the "escape" from complex topologies could be reused in similar contexts.
